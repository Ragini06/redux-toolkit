//Reasons for preferring RTK(Redux ToolKit):
Redux ToolKit solves various issues by providing a hook-based implementation of Redux 
RTK gives the ability to write mutable state updates in the reducers.
It also eliminates the use of extra coding by providing boilerplates.
RTK also has the feature of RTK query which eliminates the use of Thunks and makes the query processing faster
It also provides automatic support for Redux Dev-tools Extension and for immer.js library which is a great tool to deal with immutable objects. 
You can also use the various predefined functions of Redux Toolkit which not only speeds up the process but also saves time.
